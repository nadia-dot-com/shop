# Performance Optimization

To maintain a high Lighthouse score, the application includes:

- **Lazy Loading** – split the main bundle into smaller chunks using `React.lazy`
- **LCP Optimization** – critical product images use `fetchpriority="high"`
- **Accessibility improvements**:
  - ARIA labels
  - semantic HTML (`ul` / `li`)
  - keyboard navigation support
